This editor itself uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). If you are not familiar with Markdown, below is a brief introduction.

## Markdown 

Markdown is a way of writing webpages HTML without using code. It's mostly just plain text (like writing on a typewriter !) , except there are a few special characters (`# * __ [^1] `) that allow you to add styling & footnotes. It may take a couple of minutes to get used to, but after this, you will probably save time fixing errors that often happen when using a WYSIWYG editor.

The buttons on top actually generate the 

## Paragraphs 
Paragraphs can be written like this. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. Markdown can recognize a paragraph by leaving a whiteline.

Thus, now that I've skipped a line, this is a second paragraph.

## Headers `#` 
Headers are defined by using `#`. There are six levels. The first three levels are automatically included in the table of contents. If you want smaller headers, use more ##. Titles added like this will also be included into the TOC.

## Lists
To get ordered lists, write a number and a point, 1. , 2. , 3. 
1. one
2. two
3. three

To get bullet points:

* my first point
* another throught
* yet another thought

## Links
Links are inserted using `[text](http://example.com)`

## Footnotes
This is my footnote [^1]. To creat one, you can also press the footnote button [xÂ²]

[^1]: this is the footnote text.
