# Angular editor:

* make object list more like a list of files (especially when minimized)
* perhaps it should be a list of names and a detail view (where you can edit ?)

ideas:

* dropzone for files ? 



## Backend:

* Use https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor
* single text tool
* insertion of tools 
* list of objects below ? or in tab
* pandoc word to rcexposition
* rcexposition model change 
* add CSS for entire page
* css classes for tools as option in interface
* notation !{} for tools

** Notes to self: if cannot find some node_modules/.. etc.. try npm install first !
